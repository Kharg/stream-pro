## Introduction

This extension adds two features to the EspoCRM stream: 
- displaying the full date and time; By default, EspoCRM shows a short datetime on the stream, but with this extension, users can see the full date and time directly in the stream. 
- Stream updates expanded by default, so users can see the full update without having to click on the 'expand' button.
After installation visit /#Admin/StreamPro to enable/disable features.
